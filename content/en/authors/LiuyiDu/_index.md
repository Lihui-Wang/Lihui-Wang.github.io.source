I received my Bachelor of Science degree from South China Normal University in 2025. My research interests lie in the interpretability analysis of emotion recognition models, exploring whether neural networks can simulate human emotional understanding and expression. I also aim to identify distinctive facial expression patterns in individuals with mental disorders by building models, with the goal of contributing these findings to clinical applications for assisting in the diagnosis of mental illnesses.
