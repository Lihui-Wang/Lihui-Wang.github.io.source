Graduated from Tongji University with a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Design, I hope to combine the fields of design and psychology, and think about translating the results of psychological theories into realizations that help people in their daily lives. Currently, I am researching the treatment of mental illnesses such as anxiety through VR games.
