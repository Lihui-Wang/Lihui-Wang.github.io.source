My current research focuses on the common structure of saccades and microsaccades in perception. I am particularly interested in the cognitive function of eye movements. From an embodied perspective, how do the eye movements shape the perception and how the eye movements are subjectively influenced? With a passion to ask why and how, I joined the lab for developing a systematic method to seek the answers. Beyond science, I am a dog fanatic and hope for a lab golden retriever mascot one day.
