I got my master degree of physiology from East China Normal University in 2015, and my doctor degree of psychology from School of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University in 2020. From Sep. 2020, I did my postdoctoral research in Shanghai mental health center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine. My researches concern the cognitive and neural mechanism of attention and perception, especially the dynamic nature of attentional control and how the dynamic natures are modulated by the neural oscillations. My researches have been published in Journal of Visionï¼ŒAttention, Perception and Psychophysics et. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my researches. In my spare time, I like playing badminton, hiking, climbing, swimming and so on.
